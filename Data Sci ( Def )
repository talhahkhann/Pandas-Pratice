What is Data Science ?

Data science involves using data to find insights and solve problems. Essentially, a data scientist turns messy data into useful information. They might analyze data to improve business decisions, predict trends, or even help in areas like health and government. For example, companies like Target use data to understand customer needs, while political campaigns analyze data to reach voters. Despite some concerns about privacy, data science can also be used to do good, like improving public services or helping communities.
