Different Supplies of Data ?

Throughout the book, we’ll
be learning about data science concepts by solving problems that you encounter at
work. Sometimes we’ll look at data explicitly supplied by users, sometimes we’ll look
at data generated through their interactions with the site, and sometimes we’ll even
look at data from experiments that we’ll design.
